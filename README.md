# LeetCodeJournal
 - Produce brute force solution (without IDE!)
 - Optimize solution
 - If solution not optimal, search discussions optimal solution
 - Understand the optimal solution 

## Things I've Learned
 - Don't use data structures unnecessarily
   - try not to use prebuilts (ex: arraylist) unless necessary
 - Don't over engineer code (is there a simpler approach? Do I really need to use this algorithm? etc.)
 - When in doubt, write it out
 - Follow your instinct when deciding an approach to take

## Reflections - easy
 - #1 TwoSum: Simplify code! Always be trying to code less. In this case, I should have figured out a way to combine my two loops into one. 
 - #104 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree: I need to practice writing recursive functions specifically work on choosing the most efficient base case. 
 - #121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks: Don't use data structures unnecessarily and Don't over engineer code.
 - #217 Contains Duplicate: An easy question to solve using HashSet. 
 - #253 MaximumSubarray: Decide on an approach (follow instinct) and work out cases. I had the right idea but thought I could work everything out in my head. When in doubt, put pen to paper. 

## Reflections - medium
 - #238 Product of Array Except Self: I'm very proud to have figured this out by myself! Need to keep in mind when it's necessary to save intermediate values and when they can just be discarded (in order to save space)
