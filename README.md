# LeetCodeJournal
 - Produce brute force solution (without IDE!)
 - Optimize solution
 - If solution not optimal, search discussions optimal solution
 - Understand the optimal solution 

## Things I've Learned
 - Don't use data structures unnecessarily
   - try not to use prebuilts (ex: arraylist) unless necessary
 - Don't over engineer code (is there a simpler approach? Do I really need to use this algorithm? etc.)

## Reflections - easy
 - #1 TwoSum: Simplify code! Always be trying to code less. In this case, I should have figured out a way to combine my two loops into one. 
 - #104 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree: I need to practice writing recursive functions specifically work on choosing the most efficient base case. 
 - #121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks: Don't use data structures unnecessarily and Don't over engineer code.
 - #217 Contains Duplicate: An easy question to solve using HashSet. 
 - #253 MaximumSubarray: What i got from this question is follow your instinct and work out base cases. I had the write idea but thought I could work everything out in my head.
